# Simple Command-Line Calculator

A basic interactive calculator built in Python for performing fundamental arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) via the command line. This project highlights user input handling, conditional logic, and essential error management.

## Features

* Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Handles non-numeric input gracefully.
* Prevents division by zero.
* Allows multiple calculations or an option to exit.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository (if you're running it locally):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Newton-Kal/python-cli-calculator.git](https://github.com/Newton-Kal/python-cli-calculator.git)
    cd python-cli-calculator
    ```

2.  **Run the calculator:**
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

Fantastic! You've successfully uploaded your first project's code!
You should now be back on the main page for your python-cli-calculator repository. You should see calculator.py listed alongside README.md and .gitignore.
Step 4: Update the README.md for Your Calculator Project
This is crucial because it's what people will read first to understand your project without needing to look at the code.
 * Find the README.md file: On your python-cli-calculator repository page, click directly on the file named README.md.
 * Edit the file: On the right side of the README.md content, you'll see a pencil icon (for "Edit this file"). Click on it.
 * Paste the updated README.md content: Delete all the existing text in the README.md editing box, and then paste the following content:

## Example Usage


     Welcome to the Command-Line Calculator! 
   Operations: +, -, *, /
   Type 'exit' to quit.
   Enter first number (or 'exit'): 10
   Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
   Enter second number: 5
   Result: 15.0
   Enter first number (or 'exit'): hello
   Error: Invalid number input. Please enter numerical values.
   Enter first number (or 'exit'): 7
   Enter operator (+, -, *, /): /
   Enter second number: 0
   Result: Error: Cannot divide by zero!
   Enter first number (or 'exit'): exit
   Exiting calculator. Goodbye!

## Future Enhancements (Ideas for continued development)

* Add more mathematical operations (e.g power).
* Implement a history feature to review past calculations.
* Improve user interface with clear prompts and formatting.
